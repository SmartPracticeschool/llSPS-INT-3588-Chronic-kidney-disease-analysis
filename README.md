Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated it in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests, we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases. Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease.The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem, the predicted survival of the patient after the illness, the pattern of the disease and work for curing the disease.


The task is to classify patients into two groups. In the first group there are patients who have Chronic Kidney Disease and in the second patients without this disease. Initial data set contains personal parameters such as age, blood pressure etc. And the last parameter is the class of particular patient, which shows presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease (ckd/notckd). This is achieved by using a Machine Learning model trained with Decision Tree Classification algorithm.
